# Lab 9

## Overview


- Create models, views, and templates for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting books.
- Implement URL routing for each of the CRUD operations.
- Use Django's form handling to process and store data from the user.

## Steps

1. **Views**:
   - Implement views to:
     - List all books (`list_books`)
     - Add a new book (`add_book`)
     - Edit an existing book (`edit_book`)
     - Delete a book (`delete_book`)

2. **URLs**:
   - Configure URLs for each CRUD operation (`add_book`, `edit_book`, `delete_book`, and `list_books`).

3. **Templates**:
   - Create HTML templates for:
     - Displaying the list of books.
     - Displaying forms for adding and editing books.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the functionality by interacting with the website to add, edit, and delete books.
